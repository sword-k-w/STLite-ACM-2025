# Fibonacci/relaxed heaps have better time complexity over leftist/skew/binomial/pairing trees/heaps:
#   in insertion, as O(1)
#   in union, as O(1)
# but worse coefficients.
# In comparison, here are two possible outputs.
# 1. skew heap

Small test:
Function "TestInsertion1" has taken 1 ms.
Function "TestInsertion2" has taken 1 ms.
Function "TestUnion" has taken 1 us.
Function "TestFindMin" has taken 0 us.

Larger test:
Function "TestInsertion1" has taken 7026 ms.
Function "TestInsertion2" has taken 9884 ms.
Function "TestUnion" has taken 9 us.
Function "TestFindMin" has taken 0 us.
Function "TestDeletion" has taken 64592 ms.

# 2. fibonacci heap

# It's worthy to write fibonacci heaps.
